I am a mathematics PhD student at [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en?set_language=en) under the supervision of [Thomas Krämer](https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~kraemeth/index.html). Before starting my PhD in October 2020, I was a master's student at [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html), where I wrote my master's thesis under the supervision of [Klaus Altmann](http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/altmann/). I am also part of the [Berlin Mathematical School](https://www.math-berlin.de). Before moving to Berlin, I was an undergraduate student at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), where I wrote my bachelor's thesis under the supervision of [Holger Kammeyer](https://topology.math.kit.edu/21_375.php).

Research interests
======
My main research interests concern several aspects of algebraic geometry as well as its connections to topology, representation theory and discrete geometry.
I am currently studying abelian varieties via monodromy properties of local systems and perverse sheaves.
Throughout my master's studies I focused my studies on toric varieties. I continue to be interested in their study, in particular the possibility of understanding their algebro-geometric properties with discrete-geometric methods.
In my bachelor's I studied mostly algebraic topology and now try to incorporate the topological study of the algebro-geometric objects at hand.
